# Simple-blog-api
A simple blog implementing clean code architecture with node, express and mongodb.
The api focus on leveraging uncle bob's clean architecture for microservices in node.

```bash
npm install
```

## Contribution
Am looking forward to learning other microservices architecture in node. Feel free to pull request if you can improve the code.
